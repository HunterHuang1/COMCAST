Assignment of Comcast

steps to run the program:

npm install
/src node fetchdata.js
/comcast npm start
description: Here The Project Consists of two parts. The node part to extract the data from two html files. I used fs and jquery to help fetch data. The fetchdata.js is the code. And fetch data into the given manner, output into the json file(obj1.json and obj2.json)

And then i used react to do the app development, total 3 components. Search component to do the filter, hotels component do the data processing, and hotel component to do the presentation.

On the screen, you must select the website type(2) , then the destination(2), then the check-in/out time(10/20 - 10/27) then You can see the hotel units below. Also you can select sort by price, then click search to do the hotel sorting.

You can also change the website and destination, but hotel.com responds to Chicago and expedia relates to NewYork. just 2 pairs. Wrong pair shows nothing.
